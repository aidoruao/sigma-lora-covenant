forbidden_topologies:
  mixed_axis_node:
    id: FORBIDDEN_001
    name: MIXED_AXIS_NODE
    pattern: Node encodes multiple orthogonal concerns in single structure
    structural_invalidity: Violates axis independence, prevents clean navigation
    example: File that is both COVENANT_ROOT and OPERATIONAL_MODE_ENFORCER
    detection: Node matches multiple NODE_CLASS definitions
    
  authority_through_connectivity:
    id: FORBIDDEN_002
    name: AUTHORITY_THROUGH_CONNECTIVITY
    pattern: Authority derived from number of incoming edges or centrality
    structural_invalidity: Authority must be explicit property, not emergent
    example: Hub node gains authority because many modules depend on it
    detection: Authority level correlates with fan-in count
    
  optimization_shortcut:
    id: FORBIDDEN_003
    name: OPTIMIZATION_SHORTCUT
    pattern: Edge added to reduce path length or improve performance
    structural_invalidity: Topology is navigation map, not execution graph
    example: Direct edge bypassing intermediate verification steps
    detection: Edge violates VERIFICATION_MONOTONICITY or TEMPORAL_ORDERING
    
  emergent_hub:
    id: FORBIDDEN_004
    name: EMERGENT_HUB
    pattern: Node gains special status through accumulation of connections
    structural_invalidity: Node classes are fixed, cannot emerge through usage
    example: Module becomes de facto standard through popularity
    detection: High-connectivity node without explicit hub NODE_CLASS
    
  scale_reinterpretation:
    id: FORBIDDEN_005
    name: SCALE_REINTERPRETATION
    pattern: Topology meaning changes based on node/edge count
    structural_invalidity: Structure must be scale-invariant
    example: Small repo rules differ from large repo rules
    detection: Validation rules reference absolute counts or thresholds
    
  load_based_routing:
    id: FORBIDDEN_006
    name: LOAD_BASED_ROUTING
    pattern: Edge traversal determined by runtime metrics
    structural_invalidity: Topology is static structure, not dynamic router
    example: Import resolution based on performance monitoring
    detection: Edge selection uses runtime data
    
  conditional_constraint:
    id: FORBIDDEN_007
    name: CONDITIONAL_CONSTRAINT
    pattern: CONSTRAINT_LAYER binding varies based on context
    structural_invalidity: Constraints are absolute, not contextual
    example: GRACE applies unless system under stress
    detection: Constraint enforcement has conditional logic
    
  verification_downgrade:
    id: FORBIDDEN_008
    name: VERIFICATION_DOWNGRADE
    pattern: Path exists from high-verification node to low-verification node that bypasses checks
    structural_invalidity: Violates VERIFICATION_MONOTONICITY invariant
    example: HASH_CHAIN artifact references NONE artifact without explicit downgrade justification
    detection: Verification level decreases along dependency path
    
  mode_blending_edge:
    id: FORBIDDEN_009
    name: MODE_BLENDING_EDGE
    pattern: Edge carries operations from multiple incompatible modes
    structural_invalidity: Modes have hard boundaries
    example: Edge that permits both FORENSIC and interpretive operations
    detection: Edge OPERATIONAL_MODE_BINDING spans incompatible modes
    
  self_modifying_topology:
    id: FORBIDDEN_010
    name: SELF_MODIFYING_TOPOLOGY
    pattern: Node or edge that alters topology structure at runtime
    structural_invalidity: Topology is construction blueprint, not executable
    example: Script that adds/removes edges based on analysis results
    detection: Code modifies topology definition files
